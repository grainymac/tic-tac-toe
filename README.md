# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

Build a web application of the game: Tic-Tac-Toe.  This project should showcase my understanding and foundation on what I have learned in module 1 and beyond.

## Learning Goals

- practice Dry code
- Refactor more...and then again
- iterators
- class to class iterations

### Personal Goals

- Functional application
- DRY code
- Commit more
- -data model/ DOM manipulation

### Summary

- I started my project by designing my structure with the HTML.  I came up with a random colour scheme and then started building an idea of how my web application might look.  I started added classes to tags and making comments for id's for javascript use later on. Then started building my stylesheet.  After I got a good idea of what I wanted it to look like, I designed the pixel art characters and put them in the HTML.  I started working on the main.js file first adding my query selectors, event listeners and functions.  I then went over to developing my classes and started building the winning conditions for the game. 


### Challenges

- building the web application using the data model only.
- class iterations
- refreshing the DOM
